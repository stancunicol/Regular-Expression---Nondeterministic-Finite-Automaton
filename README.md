# Regular-Expression---Nondeterministic-Finite-Automaton
# **Description**

Regular Expression to NFA is a project that converts a regular expression into a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA). This process is essential in lexical analysis, commonly used in compilers and interpreters.


# **Features**

Regular expression parsing – interpretation and validation of regular expressions.

NFA construction – conversion of a regular expression into an NFA using Thompson's algorithm.

Automaton visualization – representation of states and transitions.

Simulation – testing the NFA with different input strings.

# **Technologies Used**

Language: C++

Paradigm: Algorithmic processing of formal languages
